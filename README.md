# IMDb-Clone
Hi, I have made an IMDb clone, using the OMDB API.
Currently, you can search movies in the search bar, as you'll type, movies will come in the dropdown list.

You can also add a movie to favorites using the button shown on the screen.
You can go on the favorites screen and see your favorite movies, and you can also delete them using the 'bin' button in the bottom right corner.

The 'recent' tab will show the last movie that you searched.

Earlier this project was working in offline mode but not when I hosted it on Github.
But now I have fixed the bugs, and it is working completely fine.
